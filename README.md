# Orders and Tip Calculator

Project done by Carlos Cruz in order to practice more React. The basic and key features implemented in this little project:

- It is done, of course, in React, with **Vite** to configure the environment easily.
- For the CSS, I've used **Tailwind** to also practice it.
- It's also done in **TypeScript** to get familiar with interfaces/types and avoid errors.
- Created a **custom hook** to handle the Order state.
- Created various components like `OrderItem`, `MenuItem`, `OrderTotal`, and `Tip`.
- Utilized **React Hooks** like `useMemo` for performance improvements.
