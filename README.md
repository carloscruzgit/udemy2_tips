# Orders and Tip calculator

Project done by Carlos Cruz in order to practice more React. The basic and key features implemented on this little project:
-It is done of course in React, with Vite to configure the environment easily.
-For the CSS, I've used Tailwind in order to also practice it.
-It's also done in TypeScript to get in touch with interfaces/types and avoid errors
-Created a custom hooks to handle the Order state.
-Create various components like OrderItem, MenuItem, OrderTotal and Tip
-Usage of React Hooks like useMemo for performance.
